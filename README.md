The objective of the game is to bend light, water, or some other physics based elements to open a door on the opposite side of the map from where the player starts. The player must traverse platforms with hazards to reach these elements as well as to reach the door. Once the player reaches the door the next level will start. The score the player earns in each level is the remaining amount of time. There will be three stages in each level introducing a element, upon completion of the level the player will earn the element and can be able to use it at will. The total points will be added from each stage and together will the final score for the level.
